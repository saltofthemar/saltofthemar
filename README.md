## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marlowe (aka saltofthemar), and âœ¨I have been captured by the joy of codingâœ¨ since learning Watcom Basic in Grade 7 (in the 90's!). I live in a small rural town on the BC coast, and currently grind my life away doing rotational shiftwork in the marine industry. Trained in graphic design, I was also once a web administrator and developer (for over a decade) and have worked with dozens of community organizations and non-profits over the years, ensuring their web presence, planning and documenting projects, and offering training and support.

For the last three years have been adapting to living with an aquired brain injury. My passion for âš¡coding, linux, music and amateur radioâš¡ are the keys to continuous healing. I am grateful and happy to share my projects with you here on GitHub -- please enjoy!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
... Upgrading my skills to include more experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and databases. Most recently, I (finally) completed CS50x, which was awesome!

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
... All about engaging with audio on the web via the Web Audio API, Tone.js and MIDI. I have been using synthesizers (hardware and DAW) for almost two decades, and it is exciting to learn how to work with sound via code and math.
