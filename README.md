## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marlowe (aka saltofthemar), and âœ¨I have been captured by the joy of codingâœ¨ since learning Watcom Basic in Grade 7 (in the 90's!). Trained in graphic design for print and web, I started out working on magazines and newspapers. I quickly become a web administrator, developer, WordPress/Drupal/Moodle wizard, and eventually a Linux systems administrator. I have helped dozens of community organziations over the years, ensuring they have a meaningful and effective web presence. 

I find these days I use Linux for everything, even as my main development and design environment, and am constantly amazed at the power of open-source. Ask me about my local development stack! My passion for âš¡computer science, music and amateur radioâš¡ have been the keys to healing from a brain injury. I live with the effects of an aquired brain injuty, and have firsthand experience using the web without all the bells and whistles. Progressive enhancement is the name of the game, along with DRY, maintainable, self-documenting code!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

... Building a python-based shortwave radio listening log app for non-hams, to encourage folks to get more engaged with the power of radio and to give folks a way of translating and keeping track of international news that may be otherwise inaccessible to them.

... Creating a multi-step intake tool for new clients that helps them brainstorm key website goals, then share and save those resources connected to their project.
