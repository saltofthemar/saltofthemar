## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marlowe (aka saltofthemar), and âœ¨I have been captured by the joy of codingâœ¨ since learning Watcom Basic in Grade 7 (in the 90's!). I live in a small rural town on the BC coast, and volunteer my skills to local community organizations and people in need. I use Linux for everything these days, including my main development and design environment, and am constantly amazed at the power of open-source initiatives. Ask me about my local development stack!

Trained in graphic design for print and web, I started out working on magazines and newspapers. I quickly become a web administrator, developer, WordPress/Drupal/Moodle wizard, and eventually a Linux systems administrator. I have helped dozens of non-profits over the years, ensuring they have a meaninful and effective web presence. A big part of what I do is planning and follow up: documenting projects, and offering training and support. Now, I am focused on rescuing older websites that are lost in the fray of modern approaches and caring for abandoned WordPress installs. 

My passion for âš¡coding, linux, music and amateur radioâš¡ have been the keys to healing an injured brain injury after I was randomly assaulted during Covid. I was already focused on building accessible solutions, but with some firsthand experience using the web without all the bells and whistles I am even more engaged on implementing WACC solutions that work. Progressive enhancement is the name of the game, along with DRY, maintainable, self-documenting code.
