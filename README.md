## Hi there 👋

My name is Marlowe (aka saltofthemar), and ✨I have been captured by the joy of coding✨ since learning Watcom Basic in Grade 7. Professionally trained in graphic design for print and web, I started out working on magazines and newspapers, soon becoming a web designer, WordPress/Drupal/Moodle wizard, developer, and eventually a Linux systems administrator. 

I have helped dozens of community organziations over the years, ensuring they have a meaningful and effective web presence. I live with the effects of an aquired brain injury, and have firsthand experience using the web without all the bells and whistles. Progressive enhancement is the name of the game, along with DRY, maintainable, self-documenting code!

These days, I find I am able to use Linux as my main development and design environment, and am passionate about open-source projects. If you are a developer who wants to make the switch to a better desktop environment, please feel free to ask me about my local development stack!

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

... Building a python-based shortwave radio listening log app for non-hams, to encourage folks to get more engaged with the power of radio and to give folks a way of translating and keeping track of international news that may be otherwise inaccessible to them.

... Creating a multi-step intake tool for new clients that helps them brainstorm key website goals, then share and save those resources connected to their project.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

... I am studying for my Linux System Administrator certification through the Linux Foundation.
